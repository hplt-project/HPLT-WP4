SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.\nSNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc.\nOverview and basic concepts.\nIn common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an \"agent\" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems.\nSNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as \"free memory\", \"system name\", \"number of running processes\", \"default route\"). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration.\nThe managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly.\nSmithland, Kentucky\nSmithland is a city of Kentucky in the United States.\nSmiths Grove, Kentucky\nSmiths Grove is a city of Kentucky in the United States.

After the creation of the lake, the place became a recreational area. It included \"a boathouse at the foot of Locust street, hotels and club houses were numerous and the lake was the scene of many a pleasant rowing and fishing party.\"\nIn 1892, after a lot of litigation between Iowa and Nebraska, the Supreme Court of the United States said that Carter Lake is part of Iowa in \"Nebraska v. Iowa\", 143 U.S. 359 (1892). The general rule is that state borders follow small changes in the course of a river. However, the Court said that an there's an exception when a river avulses one of its bends. In 1972, the Supreme Court made another ruling about Carter Lake when it ruled on a border dispute between the two states in \"Nebraska v. Iowa\", 406 U.S. 117 (1972).\nGeography.\nCarter Lake is at (41.292647, -95.913989).\nThe city is surrounded on three sides by Omaha, Nebraska, and on the fourth by the Missouri River.\nThe United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of .

{"text": "Desiro\nDesiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.\nThe Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort.\nAustria.\nIn Austria, the \u00d6BB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called \"\u00d6BB 5022\". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff.\nBulgaria.\nIn 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a \u20ac67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another \u20ac117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BD\u017d and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas.\nDenmark.\nIn Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains.\nGermany.\nGermany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these \"Class 642\" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs.\nThe \"Class 642\" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the \"M\u00fcglitzbahn\", have made greater passenger numbers.\nAt first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the \"Class 642\" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the \"Class 643\".\nHungary.\nRight now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with M\u00c1V (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton.\nMalaysia.\nThe 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia.\nThese EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.\nRomania.\nC\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: \"\"Regio\", \"InterRegio\" and \"InterCity\" inter-city services, but mostly on its \"InterRegio\"\" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes.\nRussia.\nIn December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, with an option for a further 16 which would be mostly made in Russia.\nSlovenia.\nSlovenian Railways works electric Desiro units that are made as DESIRO EMG 312 SR 31E. They are used as commuter stopping trains mostly on connections to and between Ljubljana and Maribor on the following lines:\nSwitzerland.\nSBB-CFF-FFS works double-decker (bilevel cars) EMU's. They are designated as class SBB RABe 514. They are used as commuter trains in Z\u00fcrich, where 61 four-car sets have been working since 2006.\nThailand.\nNine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 360/2 will be used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which is right now under running test from the locomotive shop in Asoke to Suvarnabhumi Station under the airport."}

{"text": "SR Class 4DD\nConceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway's Dartford commuter route, the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain. The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."}
