{"text": "Chess and computers\nChess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer. In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea,p87 and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science.\nThere are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways.\nChess engines.\nChess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref>p87 The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner.\nCompetitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage.\nFritz.\nFritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist, published by ChessBase. It is the current market leader. There is also a different kind of Fritz called \"Deep Fritz\" that is made for multi-processing. The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12. They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin, who said that \"Fritz is like a woman that you can't get with. It just drives (makes) you to think in ways you've never thought before\".\nShredder.\nShredder is a leading engine. It is also owned by ChessBase. It comes in various forms: Shredder 12, Deep Shredder 12; Shredder Classic. It has a reputation of being hard.\nRybka.\nRybka, a product by Vasik Rajlich, is Shredder's main rival. Rybka 4 is their latest version.\nChess databases.\nChess databases do not actually play. They give access to the recorded history of master chess. There are two components. First, there is the software, which lets one search and organise the database material. Then there is the actual database, typically one to four million games.\nIn practice, databases are used for two purposes. First, for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings. Second, to look up specific opponents to see what they play, and prepare against them beforehand.\nThe existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age.\nChessBase.\nChessBase is the biggest database, and widely used by masters. Although it can be used online, most users download the software and data onto their laptop. Then they take the laptop to tournaments, to help prepare for games. Players may not use computers or any other aid during games, but much preparation goes on behind the scenes. ChessBase has to be purchased, and it is not cheap.\nNew in Chess.\nThis is a Dutch magazine for advanced players, which runs an on-line database called NicBase as part of its services. NicBase is free, and has over a million games.\nChessgames.\nChessgames.com runs an on-line database of games. It is partly free, but requires registration. Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription. It has over half a million games on its database.\nOn-line playing sites.\nThere are websites which a player can join (for a fee) and play on line. In this case, the subscriber will play against other subscribers, not a computer. All standards of players are amongst the members, and various events are on offer at different rates of play. The two leaders in this market are:"}

{"text": "Measles\nMeasles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus. People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe. People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose. They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body. These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching.\nMeasles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella. The three vaccinations are all in one injection.\nMeasles is sometimes also called \"rubeola\", but it is not the same as rubella (German measles). The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists.\nThere is no specific cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it. In the 19th century measles epidemics killed many Polynesian people."}

He grew up in Schiedam, where he married 19-year old Maria de la Quellerie on 28 March 1649. (She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35). The couple had eight children, most of whom did not live through infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.\nJoining the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1639, he served in many posts, like an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies. He then went to Japan. His most important position was that of head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Vietnam. However, he was called back from this post as it was found that he was working trade for his own account.\nIn 1651 he was asked to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa. He landed three ships \"Drommedaris\", \"Reijger\" and \"Goede Hoop\" at the future Cape Town on 6 April 1652 and strongly make the site as a way-station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The \"Walvisch\" and the \"Oliphant\" came later, having had 130 burials at sea."}

{"text": "Adelong, New South Wales\nAdelong is a small town in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia. It is a part of the Tumut Shire. About 1400 people live in the Adelong district, and 829 people live in the town. The town is about 160 kilometres west of Canberra on the Snowy Mountains Highway. The town's name comes from an Aboriginal word meaning \"along the way\" or \"plain with a river\".\nHistory.\nHamilton Hume and William Hovell were the first Europeans in to visit the area on their way back to Sydney in 1825. They described it as \"rough and difficult country.\"\nGold rush.\nAdelong was settled between 1840 and 1850. Gold was discovered at Adelong by a William Williams in 1857. The gold was on the top of Victoria Hill and was part of the Old Hill Reef. Alluvial gold was found in both Adelong Creek and Golden Gully in the same year. Adelong quickly became an important goldfield. Adelong Post Office opened on 1 January 1859.\nBy 1859 a number of gold reefs were being mined, including the Old Reef and the Great Victoria Mine. Between 1859 and 1876, 3,798 kilograms of gold was mined. During the gold rush the population grew to more than 30,000 people. Over 25 tonnes of gold was mined from 1857 to the close of the mines in 1914. The National Trust of Australia has listed the main street of Adelong and a number of buildings as being important historical places.\nA number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area. Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways.\nDuring the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines. Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery. The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s. One or two old Chinese and Indian people still lived in Adelong in the 1950s. A small town, Cornishtown, was about a mile west of Adelong till the 1940s.\nFarming.\nAfter the gold rush, farming became the main business in the area. This was mainly Merino sheep and beef cattle. Over the last 20 years a tourists have come to visit because of the pleasant scenery and gold mining history. The famous Adelong Falls, with its rich gold-mining past, is an ideal spot to for a picnic or to explore the local area."}

{"text": "Emperor Y\u016bryaku\nwas the 21st emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Y\u016bryaku to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Y\u016bryaku\"-tenn\u014d\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\nNo certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.\nTraditional history.\nAccording to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihonshoki\", Y\u016bryaku was the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingy\u014d.\nHe was the brother of Emperor Ank\u014d.\nY\u016bryaku was followed on the throne by his son, who would come to be known as Emperor Seinei.\nEvents of Y\u016bryaku's life.\nVery little is known about the events of Y\u016bryaku's life and rule. Only limited facts can be studied before the rule of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter Ank\u014d's death, Y\u016bryaku overcame others in the struggle for power. He became the new emperor.\nY\u016bryaku is known as a patron of silk. It is said that he encouraged growing mulberry bushes for silkworms to eat.\nPoems that are said to be Y\u016bryaku's are included in the \"Many\u014dsh\u016b\". A number of his verses are kept in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihonshoki.\"\nHe is credited with bringing many artisans from Korea to Japan.\nAfter his death.\nThis emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Y\u016bryaku.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\"). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") which is associated with the burial mound."}
