{"text": "Irukandji jellyfish\nThe Irukandji Jellyfish, \"Carukia barnesi\", is a species of jellyfish. It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous creature in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true.\nThe Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many symptoms. This includes:\nSometimes, people may also get fluid on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure.\nThe Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish.\nThe Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, \"Chironex Fleckeri\". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital.\nIrukandji has stingers \u2013 not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in captivity was born in Townsville, Queensland."}

{"text": "Confidence interval\nIn statistics, a confidence interval, abbreviated as CI, is a special interval for estimating a certain parameter, such as the population mean. With this method, a whole interval of acceptable values for the parameter is given instead of a single value\u2014together with a likelihood that the real (unknown) value of the parameter will be in the interval. Thus, if we're not sure of the exact number of vehicles that crossed a bridge, we can say 400 plus or minus 10 instead of just saying 400.\nThe confidence interval is based on the observations from a sample, and hence differs from sample to sample. The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called the confidence level, and the end points of the confidence interval are referred to as confidence limits.\nVery often, this is given as a percentage (for example, the 95% confidence interval). The confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level. For a given estimation procedure in a given situation, the higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval will be.\nThe calculation of a confidence interval generally requires assumptions about the nature of the estimation process, since it is primarily a \"parametric\" method. One common assumption is that the distribution of the population from which the sample came is normal. As such, confidence intervals as discussed below are not robust statistics, though changes can be made to add robustness.\nMeaning of the term \"confidence\".\nThe term \"confidence\" has a similar meaning in statistics, as in common use. In common usage, a claim to 95% confidence in something is normally taken as indicating near certainty. In statistics, a claim to 95% confidence simply means that the researcher has seen one possible interval from a large number of possible ones, from which 19 out of 20 intervals contain the true value of the parameter.\nPractical example.\nA machine fills cups with margarine. It is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250g of margarine. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X.\nThis variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250g, with a standard deviation of 2.5g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of \"n\" = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random, and the cups are weighed. The weights of margarine are \"X\"1, ..., \"X\"25, a random sample from \"X\".\nTo get an impression of the expectation \u03bc, an estimate is needed. The appropriate estimator is the sample mean:\nThe sample shows actual weights \"x\"1, ...,\"x\"25, with mean:\nIf we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. A sample mean value of 280 grams, however, would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g.\nThere is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter \"\u03bc\".\nTo calculate such an interval, the endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample \"X\"1, ..., \"X\"25, and hence are random variables themselves.\nIn our case, we may determine the endpoints by considering that the sample mean from a normally distributed sample is also normally distributed, with the same expectation \"\u03bc\", but with standard error \"\u03c3\"/\u221a\"n\" = 0.5 (grams). By standardizing, we get a random variable\nwhich depends on the parameter \u03bc to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter \"\u03bc\". Hence it is possible to find numbers \u2212\"z\" and \"z\", independent of \"\u03bc\", where \"Z\" lies in between with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b1, a measure of how confident we want to be. We take 1 - \u03b1 = 0.95. So we have:\nThe number \"z\" follows from the cumulative distribution function:\nand we get:\nThis might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95, we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter \"\u03bc\" between the stochastic endpoints\nand\nThis does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter \u03bc in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. In 95% of the cases, \"\u03bc\" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases, it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:\nAs the desired value 250 of \"\u03bc\" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated.\nThe calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where \u03bc might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We \"cannot\" say: \"with probability (1 \u2212 \u03b1), the parameter \"\u03bc\" lies in the confidence interval.\" We only know that by repetition in 100(1 \u2212 \u03b1) % of the cases, \u03bc will be in the calculated interval. In 100\u03b1 % of the cases, however, it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That is why we say: \"with confidence level 100(1 \u2212 \u03b1) %, \"\u03bc\" lies in the confidence interval.\"\nThe figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean \u03bc. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability that it contains the parameter is 95%. However, it is also possible that we may have unluckily picked the wrong one as well."}
{"text": "Hypermodern\nThe hypermoderns were a school of chess players who set out to rethink some of the principles of chess openings. The name was given to them by the Polish-French grandmaster Tartakower.\nThe key idea was, in reaction to the older ideas of Siegbert Tarrasch, to dispute control of the centre by more subtle methods. Whereas old theory was to occupy the centre with two or three pawns immediately, the hypermoderns concentrated more on attacking the opponent's centre. A characteristic first move was 1Nf3 with White, or 1...Nf6 with Black, especially in reply to 1d4. To 1e4 they favoured an asymmetric defence such as 1...e6 or 1...c5 rather than the classical reply 1...e5.\nNimzovich was the founder, and Alekhine, Tartakower, R\u00e9ti, Gr\u00fcnfeld, and Bogolyubov all took part. All were top grandmasters of the 1920s and 30s. Several modern openings owe their popularity to this group: Alekhine's Defence (1e4 Nf6); R\u00e9ti's Opening (1Nf3); the King's Indian Defence (1d4 Nf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 Bg7); the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence (1d4 Bf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 d5) and the Modern Defence (1...g6).p178"}
{"text": "Halteres\nHalteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies. They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better.\nThe halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings.\nFunction.\nHalteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight.\nThey are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight.\nEvery vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres.\nThe two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres.\nDevelopment.\nIn Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene \"Ultrabithorax\" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype.\nConvergent evolution.\nThe Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the \"forewings\" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the \"hindwings\" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution.\nGrimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and \"in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight\".\nJing\u016b was the principle wife of Emperor Ch\u016bai Her son would become known as Emperor \u014cjin.

Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.\nAfter the death of Ch\u016bai, Jing\u016b also served as regent, according to the oracle of Sumiyoshi-jinja, until her son was old enough to be emperor.\nAfter her death.\nThis empress' official name after her death (her posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jing\u016b.\nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the empress's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\").
